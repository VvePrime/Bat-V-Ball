created with spring initializr - spring web, spring data jpa with hibernate, mysql driver dependencies
mysql installed port - 3306
root joeroot

to stop mysql server- possible from windows cmd as administrator - not possible from mysql command line client and also cmd as normal user.

was not able to start until spring data jpa dependency is removed.( have to configure db if it is added )

git init by default creates master
but the default branch in github is main
so it wont push because of branch mismatch. 
may be we might have to switch to main branch and then push to directly push to remote main.

hibernate needs either xml config or hibernate.properties to define the config details
hibernate.properties will get loaded automatically.

the HQL query will not have table names but Entity names ie.
select * from player is wrong as player is table name
select * from Player is correct as Player is entity name.

just need annotations for Rest api and it will run automatically on tomcat port
if server.port=8765 is given it will run on custom port.

player -> id, name, runs, dots, fours, sixes, singles, twos, threes, outs, average
data -> date, player_id, scorecard, updatedon

average two decimal points only.

create table player ( id int not null, name varchar ( 50 ) not null, runs int not null, dots int not null, singles int not null, 
doubles int not null, threes int not null, fours int not null, sixes int not null, dismissed int not null, average float(8,2) not null,
primary key(id) );

insert into player values (21, 'Ricky', 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0);

create table day_data( date varchar(10) not null, 
player_id int not null, scorecard varchar(540), updated_on timestamp not null, primary key(date,player_id),
FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES Player(id) );

file format -> txt
content format -> datestring,player_id, scorecard

error caused because of fetch type not put to eager with one to many annotation.

save card ->
if player not present -> throw exception
if card present for the date-> exception
if card not present for the date -> insert
insert only before today, if wicket, no runs after that in score card

spring.jpa.open-in-view - keeps the session open until the request it totally execuited and response is given - useful for lazy loading.

if we move to spring-boot-starter-data-jpa we should not create session factory on own, instead we need to use autowired session factory.

if we are using sessions explicitly then we need to create transactions and commit explicitly. or we can use repo interface which does this
for us automatically.

# Start the ZooKeeper service
$ bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties

# Start the Kafka broker service
$ bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties

#Create Topic
$ bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic bat-v-ball --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

#To get TOpic Information
kafka-topics.sh

#Start producer
$ bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --topic bat-v-ball --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
add  for key value pair ->  --property "parse.key=true" --property "key.separator=:"

#start consumer
bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic bat-v-ball --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

now start writing content into producer which can be read by consumer
